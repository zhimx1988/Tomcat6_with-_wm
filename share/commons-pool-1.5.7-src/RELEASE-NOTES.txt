This is a patch release, including bugfixes only.

Changes in this version include:


Fixed Bugs:
o  POOL-189:  Awaken threads waiting on borrowObject when a pool has been closed and have them throw
      IllegalStateException.  Prior to the fix for this issue, threads waiting in borrowObject when
      close was invoked on GOP or GKOP would block indefinitely. Thanks to Bill Speirs. 
o  POOL-192:  Corrected total internal processing counter update in destroy.  Prior to the fix
      for this issue, clear(key) was leaking capacity associated with elements in the
      pool being cleared. Thanks to Helge Dannenberg.
